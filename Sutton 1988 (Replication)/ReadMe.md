# Learning to predict by the methods of temporal differences

In a 1988 paper, Richard S. Sutton published one of the most famous papers in the field of Reinforcement Learning, titled [Learning to predict by the methods of temporal differences](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00115009). In it the author presents an extended demonstration of the merits of TD-Learning.

This project is a replication of the paper in question. The [PDF file](Replication_of_Results.pdf) in this folder contains a report on the replication results and notable lessons. The [Jupyter Notebook](Sutton.ipynb) file contains the implementation of the $TD-\lambda$ algorithm used in this project.
